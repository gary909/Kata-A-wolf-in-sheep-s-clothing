    <h1>Kata: A wolf in sheep's clothing</h1>
    <p>
        Wolves have been reintroduced to Great Britain. You are a sheep farmer, and are now plagued by wolves <br>
        which pretend to be sheep. Fortunately, you are good at spotting them.<br>
<br>
        Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. Remember that you are standing at the <br>
        front of the queue which is at the end of the array:<br>
<br>
        [sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep]      (YOU ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE)<br>
        7      6      5      4      3            2      1<br>
<br>
        If the wolf is the closest animal to you, return "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep". Otherwise, <br>
        return "Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!" where N is the sheep's position in the queue.<br>
<br>
        Note: there will always be exactly one wolf in the array.<br>
<br>
        Examples<br>
        Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "sheep", "wolf", "sheep"]<br>
        Output: "Oi! Sheep number 1! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!"<br>
<br>
        Input: ["sheep", "sheep", "wolf"]<br>
        Output: "Pls go away and stop eating my sheep"<br>
